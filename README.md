You can call me with my GitHub username or simply, Bacon for short.

Have been coding with **Passion** for so many years.

Have coding experiences in: **C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Swift**, and a bit of **C, C++**.

Been working on with various platforms such as: **Node.js, Django, Express, Electron.js** (soon will be Vue.js if I have time)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a quiz/test organizer** which will be a handy tool in your upcoming tests, or quizzes! (Reviewing stuffs, probably)...
